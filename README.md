# Substitution
This branch corresponds to the substitution assignment on CS50. Program basicly asks for a key 
input which is used in the place of the alphabet and then receives a plain text to cipher. 
All alphabetical characters are substituted by their counter in key and remaining symbols are left untouched.
Code introduces different alternatives within its structure. For example using try-except 
and assert can be exchanged and traversing over the key elements can be done in the provided two ways.
